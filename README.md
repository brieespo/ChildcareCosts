# ChildcareCosts



To fulfill the requirements for the project, I did the following:
1.) I read data from two different csv files (one containing the data, and another containing the information for the county codes from the first file.)
2.) I cleaned the data by eliminating some of the unnecessary columns and by renaming the very abbreviated column names with clearer titles for my project.)
3.)
4.) I created a data dictionary (below.)
5.) I annotated my code each step of the way.
